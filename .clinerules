# Project Intelligence: Greenheck Fan Selection System

## Overview
This project involves analyzing and working with Greenheck/Accurex fan selection software, specifically focusing on the G and GB series roof-mounted fans.

## Key Patterns & Preferences

### Code Structure
- Decompiled C# code from .NET assemblies
- COM-visible classes with GUID attributes
- Repository pattern for data access (`IFanSelectorRepository`)
- Factory pattern for creating selections
- Strategy pattern for different drive types (Direct, Belt, VariGreen)

### Naming Conventions
- Models: Short codes like "G", "GB", "USFA", "VEKTOR-CD"
- Accurex models prefixed with "X": XRED→G, XREB→GB
- Sizes: Numeric strings like "103", "143HP", "203"
- Speed codes: Single letters D, G, E, P indicate direct drive

### Important Files
- `Cfs.Fans.FanSelector.dll` - Core selection logic
- `Cfs.Fans.FanSelector.Wrapper.dll` - Extended selection with post-processing
- `Cfs.Fans.MotorSelector2.dll` - Motor selection business rules
- `Cfs.Fans.DimensionWeightCalc.dll` - Dimension/weight calculations

### Data Flow
1. FanSelector receives input parameters
2. Loops through models and sizes
3. Filters by drive type availability
4. Calculates air performance
5. Applies static pressure corrections
6. Validates rating limits
7. Calculates sound outputs
8. Returns valid/invalid selections

## User Preferences
- Focus on G (direct drive) and GB (belt drive) series
- Interest in input parameters and validation checks
- Working toward understanding selection requirements

## Known Challenges
- Model data stored in database tables, not in decompiled code
- Some validation thresholds are runtime data, not hardcoded
- Complex interdependencies between drive types and accessories
